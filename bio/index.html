                    <p>Hi there! I am <strong>Claire Chisom Igwe</strong>.</p>
                    <p>My friends think my job is creating beautiful prototypes on Figma. My students would say I can't stop obsessing over responsive design using Figma auto-layouts, reusable UI components, and better design hand-offs. My clients trust me to find a quick, human-centered and elegant way to build the backbone for digital products that draw in their most delighted customers.<strong>They are all correct...</strong></p>
                    <p>For nearly 3 years, I have worked with businesses in diverse industries to accelerate their journeys towards shipping successful digital products. As a User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) designer with a keen interest in interaction design, I drive success to products by:</p>

                    <h3>From writing blissful kid stories to designing user interfaces that make for an unforgetable experience</h3>
                    <p>I always loved a good story: rom-com, crime thriller, feminist, you name it! But great stories are hard to come by. So, I chose to write them. But I always wanted to do more than tell stories. <strong>I wanted to build memories with every single story.</strong> </p>
                    <p>When I stumbled upon UI/UX design, I was a creative storywriter. I loved to write stories that fill the mind and hearts of kids with beautiful colors and life lessons. I also deeply enjoyed telling stories around real and pressing gender issues. So, I created a gender and culture blog "<strong>NotJustTalks</strong>."</p>
                    <p>This blog was my way of journaling the joys and pains of women in my community. It was all about representation, equalitity, inclusion, gender, and social justice. It had always been a passion to share my story and the stories of the everyday women that inspire me everyday. </p>
                    <p>Managing this blog on Wordpress introduced me to the fascinating world of content design, web development using CMS, digital marketing, and product management. At first, I just wanted to improve the look and feel of my blog beyond the Wordpress templates. So, front-end development with HTML, CSS, and Javascript instantly caught my fancy</p>
                    <p>But then, I naturally stumbled upon UI/UX design. And I literally got hooked for life. Finally, I found a platform that allowed me do more than tell unforgetable stories. I could actually build experiences that digital product user find so delightful that they are unforgetable.</p>

                    <p>I thoroughly enjoy working on teams teeming with talents from design and development to management and marketing. I love to pour my heart, soul and skills into products that make even a single aspect of the human life more enjoyable</p>
                    <p>I love to build beautiful digital products, bouncing off ideas with like-minded and unlike-minded people. I love the adrenaline rush from driving complex and fuzzy ideas into elegant prototypes that breeze through user testing and development. It is always a delight to see my work go from development to market</p>
                    <p>I literally obsess over accessibility, responsive design using the Figma auto-layouts, reusable UI assets, organized design system and hand-off best practices, UI design best-practices for speed and efficiency and all things user psychology.</p>
                    <p>It would be a delight to discuss your vision of a product and user experience</p>

                    <p>I love to teach. So, I volunteer as a UI/UX design coach at HerTechTrail, a non-profit that shares my passion for equipping women everywhere with game-changing tech skills and mentorship</p>
                    <p>When I am not sketching something or building wireframes on Figma, you would catch me with a novel. I love crime thrillers and African literature. Otherwise, I would be having a passioned chat about social justice, pop culture, and design.</p>
