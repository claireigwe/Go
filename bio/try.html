                    <p class="label_text"> How it all began...</p>
                    <p>When I fell madly in love with digital product design, I was proactively exploring opportunities to build value for businesses while creating a happier world for people. More than two years ago, I managed a blog that chronicled the struggles of women in my local community. I wrote short stories for kids and brands on freelance gigs, and got my hands dirty with everything from digital marketing to front-end development.<br><br><strong>Every step in this journey was a colorful opportunity to learn something new about people, products, and passion...</strong>My colorful background ensures that I care deeply about diverse aspects of the product design and development process, whether it is advocating for better UX copies and design hand-offs.</p>

                    <h4>Working as a Product Designer has been exciting...</h4>
                    <p class="label_text"> See some of the work I've done...</p>
                    <p>After more than two years designing products, my biggest superpower has become helping businesses build beautiful UI prototypes that form the backbone for digital products users love. My clients trust my mastery of design tools like Figma. It has been a thrill to bring products from concept to development using best-practices in responsive design with autolayouts, managing UI libraries on complex projects, and documentation.<br><br>In the past year, I've worked as a product designer on diverse teams, building everything from a digital registry for vetted eco-friendly consumer products to a blockchain-powered real estate SaaS.<br><br> It has also been a privilege to serve alongside my mentors at HerTechTrail as a product design (UI/UX) coach, empowering hundreds of women starting out as product designers with the knowledge and support they need to excel. <br><br><strong>This is a joyful full circle journey back to a community that kickstarted my product design story</strong>. Product design has given me a platform to help women build the skills they need to create a happier world</p>

                    <h4>Fun Facts about Me...</h4>
                    <p class="label_text">This is Classified!</p>
                    <p>First, one of my proudest moments was finishing the HerTechTrail bootcamp as the best graduating student for its 2020 cohort. I found a burning passion and met so many beautiful people at the close of a pandemic, online of course, while learning the rocket-science behind product design.<br><br>Second, there is a long consonance in my name with a story. <strong>Chisom Claire Cleopatra Igwe </strong> - My parents picked the first two names and my surname, of course. I picked the name Cleopatra as a teenager looking for another cool name that just started with a "C." I guess I love a good consonance.<br><br>Third, when I'm not designing something beautiful on Figma, you would find me pouring over fiction. I love literature, romance in particular.</p>
